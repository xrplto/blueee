# XRPL BLUE Whitepaper

## Project Purpose

XRPL BLUE is designed to be the pulse-pounding social catalyst and community-driven meme coin of the XRP Ledger, seamlessly woven into the fabric of the XRPL ecosystem as a high-octane utility token. Our mission is to skyrocket through the crypto stratosphere by expanding our ever-growing constellation of integrations across the XRPL universe!

For too long, the XRP Ledger has been associated primarily with traditional finance use cases. XRPL BLUE aims to bring a fresh, vibrant energy to the ecosystem, showcasing the network's potential for community-driven projects and decentralized applications.

## Token Utility

XRPL BLUE tokens are designed to be utilized across the XRPL ecosystem. In particular, it is highlighted that XRPL BLUE:

- Serves as a medium of exchange within the XRPL BLUE ecosystem and partner applications
- Provides governance rights for community-driven initiatives and development decisions
- Offers staking rewards to incentivize long-term holding and community participation
- Enables access to exclusive features and services within the XRPL BLUE ecosystem
- Acts as a reward mechanism for community engagement and content creation

## Distribution

XRPL BLUE is committed to a fair and equitable launch strategy that prioritizes community ownership and participation. The total supply of 100 billion XRPL BLUE tokens will be distributed as follows:

- 90% Fair Launch Distribution: BLUE will conduct a fair launch through First Ledger, purchasing 90% of the circulating supply and distributing it to NFT holders. This approach ensures a wide and fair initial distribution among community members.

- 5% Team and Advisors: Subject to a 3-year linear vesting schedule to align long-term incentives.

- 3% Ecosystem Development: Reserved for future partnerships, integrations, and ecosystem growth initiatives.

- 2% Community Treasury: Controlled by XRPL BLUE DAO for community-driven initiatives and ongoing project development.

This distribution model aims to:

1. Maximize community ownership from the outset
2. Prevent large initial token concentrations
3. Reward early supporters and NFT holders
4. Maintain a small allocation for team incentives and project development

The fair launch through First Ledger and distribution to NFT holders will be conducted transparently, with detailed mechanics to be announced prior to the launch event.
