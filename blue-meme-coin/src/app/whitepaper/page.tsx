            <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">XRPL BLUE is designed to be the pulse-pounding social catalyst and community-driven meme coin of the XRP Ledger, seamlessly woven into the fabric of the XRPL ecosystem as a high-octane utility token. Our mission is to skyrocket through the crypto stratosphere by expanding our ever-growing constellation of integrations across the XRPL universe!</p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">For too long, the XRP Ledger has been associated primarily with traditional finance use cases. XRPL BLUE aims to bring a fresh, vibrant energy to the ecosystem, showcasing the network&apos;s potential for community-driven projects and decentralized applications.</p>
          </section>

          <section id="token-utility">
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 border-b border-blue-400 pb-2">Token Utility</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">XRPL BLUE (ticker symbol BLUE) is a native cryptographically-secure fungible protocol token of the XRPL BLUE ecosystem. It is a transferable representation of attributed utility functions specified in the protocol/code of the XRPL BLUE ecosystem, designed to be used solely as an interoperable utility token thereon.</p>
            <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">BLUE is a functional multi-utility token which will be used as the medium of exchange between participants who interact within the ecosystem on the XRP Ledger. The goal of introducing BLUE is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants who interact within the ecosystem without any intermediaries such as centralized third party entities/institutions/credit.</p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">It is important to note that BLUE is not, and not intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public as payment for goods or services or for the discharge of a debt. BLUE does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or interest in the Company, the Distributor, their respective affiliates, or any other company, enterprise or undertaking.</p>

          <section id="distribution">
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 border-b border-blue-400 pb-2">Distribution</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">XRPL BLUE is committed to a fair launch, ensuring a community-focused approach from day one. The distribution of XRPL BLUE tokens will be as follows:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
              <li>90% Community Distribution: Bought at First Ledger and then distributed to NFT holders</li>
              <li>10% AMM Pool: Left in the Automated Market Maker pool to ensure liquidity and support the fair token launch</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">This distribution model ensures that the vast majority of the token supply is in the hands of the community from the start, promoting decentralization and fair participation in the XRPL BLUE ecosystem. The 10% left in the AMM pool helps maintain liquidity and supports the fair launch mechanism, allowing for smoother trading and price discovery.</p>
