            <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">XRPL BLUE is designed to be the pulse-pounding social catalyst and community-driven meme coin of the XRP Ledger, seamlessly woven into the fabric of the XRPL ecosystem as a high-octane utility token. Our mission is to skyrocket through the crypto stratosphere by expanding our ever-growing constellation of integrations across the XRPL universe!</p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">For too long, the XRP Ledger has been associated primarily with traditional finance use cases. XRPL BLUE aims to bring a fresh, vibrant energy to the ecosystem, showcasing the network's potential for community-driven projects and decentralized applications.</p>

            <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">XRPL BLUE (ticker symbol BLUE) is a native cryptographically-secure fungible protocol token of the XRPL BLUE ecosystem. It is a transferable representation of attributed utility functions specified in the protocol/code of the XRPL BLUE ecosystem, designed to be used solely as an interoperable utility token thereon.</p>
            <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">BLUE is a functional multi-utility token which will be used as the medium of exchange between participants who interact within the ecosystem on the XRP Ledger. The goal of introducing BLUE is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants who interact within the ecosystem without any intermediaries such as centralized third party entities/institutions/credit.</p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">It is important to note that BLUE is not, and not intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public as payment for goods or services or for the discharge of a debt. BLUE does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or interest in the Company, the Distributor, their respective affiliates, or any other company, enterprise or undertaking.</p>
